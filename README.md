## Event Planner Galway
For my project I developed an application that allows users to insert, edit, delete and update events. A user can navigate to the 'Book' page and enter in the prompted details in the input field. This information is then stored in the MongoDB database and is available for the user to view in the 'Events' page. The user is then able to edit or update these details from this page. On my home page I have inserted some information about the website and what type of service they offer. On the bottom of the page I have included some a testimonial section of previous customers. When the user adds, edit, delete or updates an event an alert is displayed to the user to show that there input was successful. 

When the user is entering in the details of there event they are required to fill in all details so that all information about the event can be recieved by the company. The user can later edit there event if they need to. 

All of the resources I used to develop the website I downloaded from 'www.pexels.com'.
